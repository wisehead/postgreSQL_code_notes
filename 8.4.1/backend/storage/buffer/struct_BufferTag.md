#1.struct BufferTag

```cpp
/*
 * Buffer tag identifies which disk block the buffer contains.
 *
 * Note: the BufferTag data must be sufficient to determine where to write the
 * block, without reference to pg_class or pg_tablespace entries.  It's
 * possible that the backend flushing the buffer doesn't even believe the
 * relation is visible yet (its xact may have started before the xact that
 * created the rel).  The storage manager must be able to cope anyway.
 *
 * Note: if there's any pad bytes in the struct, INIT_BUFFERTAG will have
 * to be fixed to zero them, since this struct is used as a hash key.
