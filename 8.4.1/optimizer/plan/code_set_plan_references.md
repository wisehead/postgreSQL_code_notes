#1.set_plan_references

/*****************************************************************************
 *
 *      SUBPLAN REFERENCES

 *****************************************************************************/

/*
 * set_plan_references
 *
 * This is the final processing pass of the planner/optimizer.  The plan
 * tree is complete; we just have to adjust some representational details
 * for the convenience of the executor:
 *
 * 1. We flatten the various subquery rangetables into a single list, and
 * zero out RangeTblEntry fields that are not useful to the executor.
 *
 * 2. We adjust Vars in scan nodes to be consistent with the flat rangetable.
 *
 * 3. We adjust Vars in upper plan nodes to refer to the outputs of their
 * subplans.
 *
 * 4. We compute regproc OIDs for operators (ie, we look up the function
 * that implements each op).
 *
 * 5. We create lists of specific objects that the plan depends on.
 * This will be used by plancache.c to drive invalidation of cached plans.
 * Relation dependencies are represented by OIDs, and everything else by
 * PlanInvalItems (this distinction is motivated by the shared-inval APIs).
 * Currently, relations and user-defined functions are the only types of
 * objects that are explicitly tracked this way.
 *
 * We also perform one final optimization step, which is to delete
 * SubqueryScan plan nodes that aren't doing anything useful (ie, have
 * no qual and a no-op targetlist).  The reason for doing this last is that
 * it can't readily be done before set_plan_references, because it would
 * break set_upper_references: the Vars in the subquery's top tlist
 * wouldn't match up with the Vars in the outer plan tree.  The SubqueryScan
 * serves a necessary function as a buffer between outer query and subquery
 * variable numbering ... but after we've flattened the rangetable this is
 * no longer a problem, since then there's only one rtindex namespace.
 *
 * set_plan_references recursively traverses the whole plan tree.
 *
 * Inputs:
 *  glob: global data for planner run
 *  plan: the topmost node of the plan
 *  rtable: the rangetable for the current subquery
 *
 * The return value is normally the same Plan node passed in, but can be
 * different when the passed-in Plan is a SubqueryScan we decide isn't needed.
 *
 * The flattened rangetable entries are appended to glob->finalrtable, and
 * plan dependencies are appended to glob->relationOids (for relations)
 * and glob->invalItems (for everything else).
 *
 * Notice that we modify Plan nodes in-place, but use expression_tree_mutator
 * to process targetlist and qual expressions.  We can assume that the Plan
 * nodes were just built by the planner and are not multiply referenced, but
 * it's not so safe to assume that for expression tree nodes.
