/*
 * VariableCache is a data structure in shared memory that is used to track
 * OID and XID assignment state.  For largely historical reasons, there is
 * just one struct with different fields that are protected by different
 * LWLocks.
 *
 * Note: xidWrapLimit and oldestXidDB are not "active" values, but are
 * used just to generate useful messages when xidWarnLimit or xidStopLimit
 * are exceeded.
