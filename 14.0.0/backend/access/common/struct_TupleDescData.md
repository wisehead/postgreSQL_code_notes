#1.struct TupleDescData

```cpp
/*
 * This struct is passed around within the backend to describe the structure
 * of tuples.  For tuples coming from on-disk relations, the information is
 * collected from the pg_attribute, pg_attrdef, and pg_constraint catalogs.
 * Transient row types (such as the result of a join query) have anonymous
 * TupleDesc structs that generally omit any constraint info; therefore the
 * structure is designed to let the constraints be omitted efficiently.
 *
 * Note that only user attributes, not system attributes, are mentioned in
 * TupleDesc.
 *
 * If the tupdesc is known to correspond to a named rowtype (such as a table's
 * rowtype) then tdtypeid identifies that type and tdtypmod is -1.  Otherwise
 * tdtypeid is RECORDOID, and tdtypmod can be either -1 for a fully anonymous
 * row type, or a value >= 0 to allow the rowtype to be looked up in the
 * typcache.c type cache.
 *
 * Note that tdtypeid is never the OID of a domain over composite, even if
 * we are dealing with values that are known (at some higher level) to be of
 * a domain-over-composite type.  This is because tdtypeid/tdtypmod need to
 * match up with the type labeling of composite Datums, and those are never
 * explicitly marked as being of a domain type, either.
 *
 * Tuple descriptors that live in caches (relcache or typcache, at present)
 * are reference-counted: they can be deleted when their reference count goes
 * to zero.  Tuple descriptors created by the executor need no reference
 * counting, however: they are simply created in the appropriate memory
 * context and go away when the context is freed.  We set the tdrefcount
 * field of such a descriptor to -1, while reference-counted descriptors
 * always have tdrefcount >= 0.
