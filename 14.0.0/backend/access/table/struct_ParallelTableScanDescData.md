/*
 * Shared state for parallel table scan.

 * Each backend participating in a parallel table scan has its own
 * TableScanDesc in backend-private memory, and those objects all contain a
 * pointer to this structure.  The information here must be sufficient to
 * properly initialize each new TableScanDesc as workers join the scan, and it
 * must act as a information what to scan for those workers.
