#1.struct ItemIdData

```cpp
/*
 * A line pointer on a buffer page.  See buffer page definitions and comments
 * for an explanation of how line pointers are used.
 *
 * In some cases a line pointer is "in use" but does not have any associated
 * storage on the page.  By convention, lp_len == 0 in every line pointer
 * that does not have storage, independently of its lp_flags state.
