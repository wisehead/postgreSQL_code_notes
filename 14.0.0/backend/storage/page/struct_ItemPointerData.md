#1.struct ItemPointerData

```cpp
/*
 * ItemPointer:
 *
 * This is a pointer to an item within a disk page of a known file
 * (for example, a cross-link from an index to its parent table).
 * ip_blkid tells us which block, ip_posid tells us which entry in
 * the linp (ItemIdData) array we want.
 *
 * Note: because there is an item pointer in each tuple header and index
 * tuple header on disk, it's very important not to waste space with
 * structure padding bytes.  The struct is designed to be six bytes long
 * (it contains three int16 fields) but a few compilers will pad it to
 * eight bytes unless coerced.  We apply appropriate persuasion where
 * possible.  If your compiler can't be made to play along, you'll waste
 * lots of space.
