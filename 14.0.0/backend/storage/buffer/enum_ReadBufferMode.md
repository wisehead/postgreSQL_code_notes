```cpp
/* Possible modes for ReadBufferExtended() */
typedef enum

	RBM_ZERO_AND_LOCK,			/* Don't read from disk, caller will
								 * initialize. Also locks the page. */
	RBM_ZERO_AND_CLEANUP_LOCK,	/* Like RBM_ZERO_AND_LOCK, but locks the page
								 * in "cleanup" mode */
	RBM_ZERO_ON_ERROR,			/* Read, but return an all-zeros page on error */
	RBM_NORMAL_NO_LOG			/* Don't log page as invalid during WAL
								 * replay; otherwise same as RBM_NORMAL */
