#1.struct PageHeaderData

```cpp
/*
 * disk page organization
 *
 * space management information generic to any page
 *
 *		pd_lsn		- identifies xlog record for last change to this page.
 *		pd_checksum - page checksum, if set.
 *		pd_flags	- flag bits.
 *		pd_lower	- offset to start of free space.
 *		pd_upper	- offset to end of free space.
 *		pd_special	- offset to start of special space.
 *		pd_pagesize_version - size in bytes and page layout version number.
 *		pd_prune_xid - oldest XID among potentially prunable tuples on page.
 *
 * The LSN is used by the buffer manager to enforce the basic rule of WAL:
 * "thou shalt write xlog before data".  A dirty buffer cannot be dumped
 * to disk until xlog has been flushed at least as far as the page's LSN.
 *
 * pd_checksum stores the page checksum, if it has been set for this page;
 * zero is a valid value for a checksum. If a checksum is not in use then
 * we leave the field unset. This will typically mean the field is zero
 * though non-zero values may also be present if databases have been
 * pg_upgraded from releases prior to 9.3, when the same byte offset was
 * used to store the current timelineid when the page was last updated.
 * Note that there is no indication on a page as to whether the checksum
 * is valid or not, a deliberate design choice which avoids the problem
 * of relying on the page contents to decide whether to verify it. Hence
 * there are no flag bits relating to checksums.
 *
 * pd_prune_xid is a hint field that helps determine whether pruning will be
 * useful.  It is currently unused in index pages.
 *
 * The page version number and page size are packed together into a single
 * uint16 field.  This is for historical reasons: before PostgreSQL 7.3,
 * there was no concept of a page version number, and doing it this way
 * lets us pretend that pre-7.3 databases have page version number zero.
 * We constrain page sizes to be multiples of 256, leaving the low eight
 * bits available for a version number.
 *
 * Minimum possible page size is perhaps 64B to fit page header, opaque space
 * and a minimal tuple; of course, in reality you want it much bigger, so
 * the constraint on pagesize mod 256 is not an important restriction.
 * On the high end, we can only support pages up to 32KB because lp_off/lp_len
 * are 15 bits.
