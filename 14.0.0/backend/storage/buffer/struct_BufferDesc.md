#1.struct BufferDesc


```cpp
/*
 *	BufferDesc -- shared descriptor/state data for a single shared buffer.
 *
 * Note: Buffer header lock (BM_LOCKED flag) must be held to examine or change
 * the tag, state or wait_backend_pid fields.  In general, buffer header lock
 * is a spinlock which is combined with flags, refcount and usagecount into
 * single atomic variable.  This layout allow us to do some operations in a
 * single atomic operation, without actually acquiring and releasing spinlock;
 * for instance, increase or decrease refcount.  buf_id field never changes
 * after initialization, so does not need locking.  freeNext is protected by
 * the buffer_strategy_lock not buffer header lock.  The LWLock can take care
 * of itself.  The buffer header lock is *not* used to control access to the
 * data in the buffer!
 *
 * It's assumed that nobody changes the state field while buffer header lock
 * is held.  Thus buffer header lock holder can do complex updates of the
 * state variable in single write, simultaneously with lock release (cleaning
 * BM_LOCKED flag).  On the other hand, updating of state without holding
 * buffer header lock is restricted to CAS, which insure that BM_LOCKED flag
 * is not set.  Atomic increment/decrement, OR/AND etc. are not allowed.
 *
 * An exception is that if we have the buffer pinned, its tag can't change
 * underneath us, so we can examine the tag without locking the buffer header.
 * Also, in places we do one-time reads of the flags without bothering to
 * lock the buffer header; this is generally for situations where we don't
 * expect the flag bit being tested to be changing.
 *
 * We can't physically remove items from a disk page if another backend has
 * the buffer pinned.  Hence, a backend may need to wait for all other pins
 * to go away.  This is signaled by storing its own PID into
 * wait_backend_pid and setting flag bit BM_PIN_COUNT_WAITER.  At present,
 * there can be only one such waiter per buffer.
 *
 * We use this same struct for local buffer headers, but the locks are not
 * used and not all of the flag bits are useful either. To avoid unnecessary
 * overhead, manipulations of the state field should be done without actual
 * atomic operations (i.e. only pg_atomic_read_u32() and
 * pg_atomic_unlocked_write_u32()).
 *
 * Be careful to avoid increasing the size of the struct when adding or
 * reordering members.  Keeping it below 64 bytes (the most common CPU
 * cache line size) is fairly important for performance.
 *
 * Per-buffer I/O condition variables are currently kept outside this struct in
 * a separate array.  They could be moved in here and still fit within that
 * limit on common systems, but for now that is not done.
