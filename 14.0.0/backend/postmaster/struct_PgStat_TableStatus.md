#1.struct PgStat_TableStatus

```cpp
/* ----------
 * PgStat_TableStatus			Per-table status within a backend
 *
 * Many of the event counters are nontransactional, ie, we count events
 * in committed and aborted transactions alike.  For these, we just count
 * directly in the PgStat_TableStatus.  However, delta_live_tuples,
 * delta_dead_tuples, and changed_tuples must be derived from event counts
 * with awareness of whether the transaction or subtransaction committed or
 * aborted.  Hence, we also keep a stack of per-(sub)transaction status
 * records for every table modified in the current transaction.  At commit
 * or abort, we propagate tuples_inserted/updated/deleted up to the
 * parent subtransaction level, or out to the parent PgStat_TableStatus,
 * as appropriate.
