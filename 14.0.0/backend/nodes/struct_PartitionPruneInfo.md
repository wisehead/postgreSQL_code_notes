#1.struct PartitionPruneInfo

```cpp
/*
 * PartitionPruneInfo - Details required to allow the executor to prune
 * partitions.
 *
 * Here we store mapping details to allow translation of a partitioned table's
 * index as returned by the partition pruning code into subplan indexes for
 * plan types which support arbitrary numbers of subplans, such as Append.
 * We also store various details to tell the executor when it should be
 * performing partition pruning.
 *
 * Each PartitionedRelPruneInfo describes the partitioning rules for a single
 * partitioned table (a/k/a level of partitioning).  Since a partitioning
 * hierarchy could contain multiple levels, we represent it by a List of
 * PartitionedRelPruneInfos, where the first entry represents the topmost
 * partitioned table and additional entries represent non-leaf child
 * partitions, ordered such that parents appear before their children.
 * Then, since an Append-type node could have multiple partitioning
 * hierarchies among its children, we have an unordered List of those Lists.
 *
 * prune_infos			List of Lists containing PartitionedRelPruneInfo nodes,
 *						one sublist per run-time-prunable partition hierarchy
 *						appearing in the parent plan node's subplans.
 * other_subplans		Indexes of any subplans that are not accounted for
 *						by any of the PartitionedRelPruneInfo nodes in
 *						"prune_infos".  These subplans must not be pruned.
