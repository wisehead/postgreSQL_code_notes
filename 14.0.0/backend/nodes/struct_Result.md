/* ----------------
 *	 Result node -
 *		If no outer plan, evaluate a variable-free targetlist.
 *		If outer plan, return tuples from outer plan (after a level of
 *		projection as shown by targetlist).
 *
 * If resconstantqual isn't NULL, it represents a one-time qualification
 * test (i.e., one that doesn't depend on any variables from the outer plan,
 * so needs to be evaluated only once).
