```cpp
/* ----------------------
 *		Select Statement
 *
 * A "simple" SELECT is represented in the output of gram.y by a single
 * SelectStmt node; so is a VALUES construct.  A query containing set
 * operators (UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT) is represented by a tree of SelectStmt
 * nodes, in which the leaf nodes are component SELECTs and the internal nodes
 * represent UNION, INTERSECT, or EXCEPT operators.  Using the same node
 * type for both leaf and internal nodes allows gram.y to stick ORDER BY,
 * LIMIT, etc, clause values into a SELECT statement without worrying
 * whether it is a simple or compound SELECT.
