/* ----------------
 *		Plan node
 *
 * All plan nodes "derive" from the Plan structure by having the
 * Plan structure as the first field.  This ensures that everything works
 * when nodes are cast to Plan's.  (node pointers are frequently cast to Plan*
 * when passed around generically in the executor)
 *
 * We never actually instantiate any Plan nodes; this is just the common
 * abstract superclass for all Plan-type nodes.
