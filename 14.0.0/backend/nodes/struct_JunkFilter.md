#1.struct JunkFilter

```cpp
/* ----------------
 *	  JunkFilter
 *
 *	  This class is used to store information regarding junk attributes.
 *	  A junk attribute is an attribute in a tuple that is needed only for
 *	  storing intermediate information in the executor, and does not belong
 *	  in emitted tuples.  For example, when we do an UPDATE query,
 *	  the planner adds a "junk" entry to the targetlist so that the tuples
 *	  returned to ExecutePlan() contain an extra attribute: the ctid of
 *	  the tuple to be updated.  This is needed to do the update, but we
 *	  don't want the ctid to be part of the stored new tuple!  So, we
 *	  apply a "junk filter" to remove the junk attributes and form the
 *	  real output tuple.  The junkfilter code also provides routines to
 *	  extract the values of the junk attribute(s) from the input tuple.
 *
 *	  targetList:		the original target list (including junk attributes).
 *	  cleanTupType:		the tuple descriptor for the "clean" tuple (with
 *						junk attributes removed).
 *	  cleanMap:			A map with the correspondence between the non-junk
 *						attribute numbers of the "original" tuple and the
 *						attribute numbers of the "clean" tuple.
 *	  resultSlot:		tuple slot used to hold cleaned tuple.
