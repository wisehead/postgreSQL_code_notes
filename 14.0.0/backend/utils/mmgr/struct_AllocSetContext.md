#1.struct AllocSetContext

```cpp
/*
 * AllocSetContext is our standard implementation of MemoryContext.
 *
 * Note: header.isReset means there is nothing for AllocSetReset to do.
 * This is different from the aset being physically empty (empty blocks list)
 * because we will still have a keeper block.  It's also different from the set
 * being logically empty, because we don't attempt to detect pfree'ing the
 * last active chunk.
