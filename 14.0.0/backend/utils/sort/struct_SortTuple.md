#1.struct SortTuple

```cpp
/*
 * The objects we actually sort are SortTuple structs.  These contain
 * a pointer to the tuple proper (might be a MinimalTuple or IndexTuple),
 * which is a separate palloc chunk --- we assume it is just one chunk and
 * can be freed by a simple pfree() (except during merge, when we use a
 * simple slab allocator).  SortTuples also contain the tuple's first key
 * column in Datum/nullflag format, and a source/input tape number that
 * tracks which tape each heap element/slot belongs to during merging.
 *
 * Storing the first key column lets us save heap_getattr or index_getattr
 * calls during tuple comparisons.  We could extract and save all the key
 * columns not just the first, but this would increase code complexity and
 * overhead, and wouldn't actually save any comparison cycles in the common
 * case where the first key determines the comparison result.  Note that
 * for a pass-by-reference datatype, datum1 points into the "tuple" storage.
 *
 * There is one special case: when the sort support infrastructure provides an
 * "abbreviated key" representation, where the key is (typically) a pass by
 * value proxy for a pass by reference type.  In this case, the abbreviated key
 * is stored in datum1 in place of the actual first key column.
 *
 * When sorting single Datums, the data value is represented directly by
 * datum1/isnull1 for pass by value types (or null values).  If the datatype is
 * pass-by-reference and isnull1 is false, then "tuple" points to a separately
 * palloc'd data value, otherwise "tuple" is NULL.  The value of datum1 is then
 * either the same pointer as "tuple", or is an abbreviated key value as
 * described above.  Accordingly, "tuple" is always used in preference to
 * datum1 as the authoritative value for pass-by-reference cases.
