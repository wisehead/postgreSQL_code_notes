	 * number of tuples in memory at any time, so we can avoid the
	 * palloc/pfree overhead by recycling a fixed number of fixed-size slots
	 * to hold the tuples.
	 *
	 * For the slab, we use one large allocation, divided into SLAB_SLOT_SIZE
	 * slots.  The allocation is sized to have one slot per tape, plus one
	 * additional slot.  We need that many slots to hold all the tuples kept
	 * in the heap during merge, plus the one we have last returned from the
	 * sort, with tuplesort_gettuple.
	 *
	 * Initially, all the slots are kept in a linked list of free slots.  When
	 * a tuple is read from a tape, it is put to the next available slot, if
	 * it fits.  If the tuple is larger than SLAB_SLOT_SIZE, it is palloc'd
	 * instead.
	 *
	 * When we're done processing a tuple, we return the slot back to the free
	 * list, or pfree() if it was palloc'd.  We know that a tuple was
	 * allocated from the slab, if its pointer value is between
	 * slabMemoryBegin and -End.

	 * When the slab allocator is used, the USEMEM/LACKMEM mechanism of
